##### More about COSC 1437
COSC 1437 or Programming Fundamentals is a class I took this summer that reintroduced me to Java. 
The last class with Java I took was back in High School and titled 'Computer Science AB,' which follows a similar curriculum as this course.
Learning Java all over again was super humbling to say the least, but since I previously learned CPP a couple months ago, it
made understanding the material a tad bit easier. Overrall, a super fun course that I hope to apply in the future!
